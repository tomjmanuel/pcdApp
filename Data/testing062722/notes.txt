Bubbles used today:
made 05/02/22
DSPC 90%
DSPE-PEG2k 10%
2.5 mg/ml JK

Data1:
- ramped pressure from 0.3 MPa up to 2 MPa. First test with new processing in pcdApp (removed noise floor and added baseline
dependent SC and IC subtraction). 
- Visualization didn't work right (everything showed similar IC and SC levels except toggling between 500 kPa and 800 kPa)

I used most of a tip of bubbles mixed into 5 ml of water flowed at 10 ml/hr

I think this is too succeptible the baseline SC and IC values. Going back to noise floor and trying again.

Data2: same as data 1

Data3 same as data 1 and 2, but noise floor changed to be everything outside SC and IC, rather than based on baselines
We got a nice smooth increase in IC with some SC dynamics. Going to process in matlab and see how it looks

Data 4 but using as much bubbles as I can fit into 2 mL of water (1 mL of bubble juice + 2ml of water

Data 5: same as 4 but doing amps 1-9 (0.3 to 0.9 MPa)

%% IDEAS to impement in pcdapp
1. running average (20 tpts /10 s) for IC and SC

2. use average of first 10 IC and SC for noisefloor (flow bubbles 30 s in)

3. less freq res (longer acquisition)

4. guass blur on spectrograms
	- tried in matlab, it seems useful
