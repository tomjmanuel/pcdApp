Bubbles used today:
made 05/02/22
DSPC 90%
DSPE-PEG2k 10%
2.5 mg/ml JK

Data1:
- ramped pressure from 0.3 MPa up to 2 MPa. First test with new processing in pcdApp (removed noise floor and added baseline
dependent SC and IC subtraction). 
- Visualization didn't work right (everything showed similar IC and SC levels except toggling between 500 kPa and 800 kPa)

I used most of a tip of bubbles mixed into 5 ml of water flowed at 10 ml/hr

I think this is too succeptible the baseline SC and IC values. Going back to noise floor and trying again.

Data2: same as data 1

Data3 same as data 1 and 2, but noise floor changed to be everything outside SC and IC, rather than based on baselines
We got a nice smooth increase in IC with some SC dynamics. Going to process in matlab and see how it looks

Data 4 but using as much bubbles as I can fit into 2 mL of water (1 mL of bubble juice + 2ml of water

Data 5: same as 4 but doing amps 1-9 (0.3 to 0.9 MPa)

Data6: trying time base 9 (dt = 96 ns)
Data7: trying timebase 6 (dt = 46 ns)

%% IDEAS to impement in pcdapp
1. running average (10 tpts) for IC and SC
- done

2. use average of first 10 IC and SC for noisefloor (flow bubbles 30 s in)
- done

3. less freq res (longer acquisition)
- done, timebase 6 (dt = 46 ns) with 500 us acquisition is in use rn

4. guass blur on spectrograms
	- tried in matlab, it seems useful
	done (blurred 1d going into spectImage

5. DC offset? seems to show up sometimes

6. Fix resample
- check, replaced with np.interp


data8. 
first try with bubbles with all these fixes
line plots were almost useless until at high pressures (maybe we aren't centered?)

Add in 1 MHz to SC mask, double check what window size should be should be +/- 10 khz which is .01 MHz or 5 samples with
timebase 6

data11: flow rate 20 ml/hr, 4 ml water 0.5 ml bubble juice, steered inward -10 (0,0,-10)
going to try it again but with huge pressure range, I wonder if we aren't at the focus so we aren't actually getting the pressure we suspect

data12: same as data 11 but with huge pressure range. This one behaves like we want but takes crazy high pressure. I suspect I am not at the focus. going to retry to find the focus and do this again
This one has good increase in both SC and IC

data13: like data12 but more at the focus. Looks the same but at somewhat lower pressure (still takes too much to cause inertial)

data14 like 12 and 13 but less pressure range. Was testing some visualization stuff
