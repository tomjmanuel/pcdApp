Concentration test today
Conc (ul/ml)	bub (ul) 	water (ml) 	name
25		500		20		conc1
18.75		375		20 		conc1b
10		200		20		conc1a
5		100		20		conc2
1		20		20		conc3
0.33		6.66		20		conc4

Amp vals: 1 to 21 (11 amps, 2 ampInc), max pressure: 1.8 MPa
Flow rate 1 mm/s (20 ml/hr with 20 ml syringe)
Do 15 s at each with 2 Hz prf
Find max of focus and then move it a little close (so focus is past wall of tube and in center of tube hopefully
Is there a dilution way I can get to the concentration I want?
Stock concentration: 25 ul/ml if I have 5 ml it becomes 125 ul If I add that to 15 ml of 0 it becomes 125 ul / 20 ml which is 6.25,
I added 4 ml of 25ul/ml to 15 more ml of water to get to 5 ul/ml
Creating 1 ul/ml by taking 4 ml of 4 ul/ml and adding 15 ul water
Created 0.33 ul/ml by taking 7 ml of 1 ul/ml and adding 13 ml of water

Last thing I’ll try since I have extra bubbles
Put the tube in front of the max on the pico scope and slowly back away from xdcr
See where max signal occurs with fixed amplitude
Starting six half turns in front of max
Working at conc1bmotortest is name and conc
I brought it up to an amp val of 13, left it there a while and then did a half turn every ten seconds
The signal came and went with a max at the true focus so I should prob just use true foci in the future.

Got a new vial of bubbles
Going straight to 10 ul/ml conc1a
Worked as may be expected. Trying again to not waste left overs

It did not really work. At first it was looking as expected but then the signal dropped out. Bubbles must have not been consistent throughout. This was conc2 try1.
Going back to stock bubbles and trying conc2 again 
Ended up trying two concentrations between 1 and 2
I tried severy multiple times (repeated results)
